Recommendation 1: Product Pricing {.smaller}
===============================================

<div style="float: center; width: 100%;">

When there are in-store promotions and small advertisements concurrently being presented to consumers, General Mills could re-evaluate their product pricing strategy. One of the reasons behind why Kelloggs might be generating a higher average revenue than General Mills in this scenario could be attributed to the higher average price Kelloggs charges for their products in this scenario. This is the only scenario where Kelloggs charges an average product price that's higher than General Mills.

===============================================

Running promotions and displaying small ads in more stores than General Mills could be another reason driving Kellogg's higher annual and average revenues. The two graphs below show the number of stores each brand ran promotions and displayed advertisements in last year.
